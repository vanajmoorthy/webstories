And this was our 1 month anniversary. I wanted to make it special so I made those fancy pork chops and I was mildly blindsided when you gave me the next Terry Pratchett book I wanted to read as a present. It made me feel special because by that point you'd given me a few gifts and they were always very thoughtful and things I'd mentioned wanting.
