The first time I visited you at Peggy's! I was nervous visiting you on my own so I made sure Jake would be there before me so I didn't seem too forward but I also wanted to make it clear that I was into you so I brought you a diet pepsi which you said "made your day". I think your telling me about how you had recently developed an affinity for diet coke was definitely a green flag. I took these creepy doll pictures to commemorate the occasion.
