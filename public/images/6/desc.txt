This was the night we went to that South Street party. I was super desperate to make sure you came so I told both Jake and Marshall about it to ensure multiple people in the cohort would make the attempt so as to increase my chances. This was the first time we danced together and I remember being pleasantly surprised by how comfortable I felt.
