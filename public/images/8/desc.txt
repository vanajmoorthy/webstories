And this was our cute little sleepover night. I remember our conversation at the windowsill about our best and worst traits. At some point you said "depends on how much you want to divulge in this conversation" and I found myself surprised because I was already comfortable telling you everything. I remember being happy about the fact that we ended up on adjacent beds and the next day Marshall told me you weren't planning on spending the night and it was implied that I was the reason you did.
